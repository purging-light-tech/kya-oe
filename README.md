# Kya Operating Environment
This is the main repository for the development of the Kya Operating Environment.  The primary architecture that we are targetting is RISC-V.  We aim to provide first class support for RISC-V and x86_64.  The primary language for the development is under debate with [Rust](https://github.com/purging-light-tech/kya-oe-rs) and [Zig](https://github.com/purging-light-tech/kya-oe-zig) being evaluated.

## Goals
- To create a modern operating enviroment for use in PCs and Servers.
- Build a community that accepts opinions of the contributers and users openly.
- All assets within the main system shall be released with a liberal open source license (MIT or BSD are currently accepted)
